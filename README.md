# My First Web Project

This is the very first web project I built while learning.  
It was created by following a tutorial, and my main goal was to understand the structure, code flow, and concepts used.  
Since this was my first attempt, I haven't organized the images into a separate folder — everything is kept as it was when I was learning.

## Features
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Follows basic web structure and styling
- Includes beginner-level functionality

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project was **learning** — it is not an original project idea but rather a practice to understand how things work in a real webpage.

## Notes
- Images are not placed in a dedicated folder because this was my first project and I kept it exactly as I built it during the tutorial.
- This project is for educational purposes only.

## How to View
Simply download the files and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
